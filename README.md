# üöÄ Turborepo Starter

[![Test and Build](https://github.com/thaitype/turborepo-starter/actions/workflows/test-and-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thaitype/turborepo-starter/actions/workflows/test-and-build.yml)

A modern **Turborepo** starter template designed for scalability, maintainability, and modularity.

## üìñ Philosophy

- **Modern Tooling:** Utilizes cutting-edge tools and best practices.
- **Modular Design:** Each project/package is **independent**, allowing easy removal of unnecessary dependencies.
- **No Root-Level Dependencies:** Avoids installing packages in the root workspace to prevent monolithic growth, making maintenance easier, except for `turbo` and `typescript`.
- **Consistent Configuration:** Shared configurations for ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript to ensure consistency across all projects.
- **TypeScript Everywhere:** All projects/packages are written in TypeScript for static type checking and improved developer experience.
- **Automated Workflows:** Includes scripts for building, testing, and linting all projects/packages at once.
- **Shared Components:** A shared React component library for reuse across all projects/packages.
- **Vite for Testing:** Uses Vite for fast and reliable testing.

## üèóÔ∏è What's Inside?

This **Turborepo** setup includes the following **apps and packages**:

### **üì¶ Apps**
